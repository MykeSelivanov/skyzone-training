Write a function that takes in an integer and returns it's largest binary gap. A binary gap is a positive number of 0's surrounded by 1's.  This will require you to convert the number to binary---this can be accomplished with num.toString(2)

Ex:
Input: 20, Output: 1
Input: 15, Output: 0
Input: 529, Ouput: 4
